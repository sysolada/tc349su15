Homepage- This page is going to show featured and new games that have just arrived or are very popular. These featured games that show on the site can be attuned to the user if they choose so. The user can fill out a form that has check boxes that will allow the user to customize their experience. Naturally the homepage will not have these check boxes on the page. They will be on a separate page. The page will also have feature scrolling slide shows with pictures of the games cover art along with a brief description of the game and genre. There will be a big picture that takes up most of the screen. The bottom will have 3 pictures that scroll across.

Browse Page- This page will feature a defining search. The user can either search a game or keyword in the search bar or they can select one of the categories that is displayed in the middle of the scree in a 6x9 pattern. The categories will feature genres of games.

Content Page- This is the page of the actual game. This will show highlights of the game and updates that are coming to the game. This will be the page that gives you the option to buy or help crowd fund the game until it is released. This is also the page that will have videos and pictures of the game so the users can have a good look at the game in its current state.
