</h2>

<h3>Affordance</h3>
<p>The website is designed to search for ongoing games of League of Legends. This represents affordance because the website looks similar to large successful search engines such as google. This similarity gives the users of the site the same perception of reliability as google because of this. </p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Mapping</h3>
<p>LoL Nexus shows good mapping because it shows the bar to type your summoner name into then directly next it it has the button to submit the search. It also shows the user what to put in the form with background text. The site also features other buttons that allow you to define the search before you do it. This makes it easy for the user to know exactly what to do the first time they visit this page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Chunking</h3>
<p>This site features chunking in a nice way. In the top chunk of the page is the main chunk. This is the part that is brainlessly used to search quickly and effectively. In the bottom chunk the site displays things about the website and what it does for the user feature wise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>S/N Ratio</h3>
<p>The website isn't too busy and displays just the right amount of content. It has it featured content right in the middle of the screen so your eyes cannot get too distracted from the less cluttered edges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Ockham's Razor</h3>
<p>This website features a simplistic design. This is because the site features only one form and one submit button. There is also other buttons that are clearly labelled to help the user select their desired region easily. This sites simplicity is on track with google's simplicity.</p>
