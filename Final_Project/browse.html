<p>This game is another survival game, but this time you are stranded alone. The forest takes place on a stranded island in the temperate forest. You are stranded there after you plane crashes. You are left with limited supplies and must acquire more to survive. The catch to this game is that think that you are alone but you are not. The island that you landed on is inhabited by mutant cannibals. You must do whatever you can to survive these beings.</p>

<br>
<h2>Rust</h2>

<p>Rust is another game where the gameplay is based around survival but is not as hardcore as the others. Rust doesn't make you depend on resources as much as DayZ. This means you can survive longer without food and water. The main concept of Rust is the huge sandbox and base building experience. This game allows you to create structures to your own desire. To do this you must gather large amounts of resources such as trees and stone. This game is also meant to be played online in large servers.</p>
